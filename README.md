# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: Yareli Gutierrez

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## Summary

Calendar_API is an android app that displays the details of a random holiday in the US during 2023.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: ðŸ¤”ðŸ“…ðŸ˜²

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is Calendarific Holiday API.

## Notes

Here's a place for any other notes on the app, it's creation process, or what you learned this unit!
Although this was the hardest project so far, I was able to learn so much about API and JSON response! 
Through each step I learned a bit more about finding the process of connecting text to the TextView options in Android Studio.
